# 🐦 Bird Sound Detector

This project is a simple **Machine Learning application** that detects and classifies **bird sounds**.  
It uses two deep learning models — **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV2** — to train on bird sound datasets and predict the bird species when a new audio clip is given as input.

---

## 📘 Overview
The main goal of this project is to identify bird species based on their recorded sounds.  
Audio files are processed using **MFCC feature extraction** and passed into pre-trained CNN architectures (ResNet50 and MobileNetV2) for classification.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation** – Bird sound recordings are collected from online datasets.  
2. **Feature Extraction** – Each audio file is converted into numerical features using MFCCs.  
3. **Model Training** – The extracted features are trained using both **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV2** models.  
4. **Prediction** – When a new bird sound is uploaded, the trained model predicts the corresponding bird species.
